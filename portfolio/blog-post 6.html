                    <h2>"what I'm exited about? Haha! Gods only knows"--> This is what a teenager is</h2>
                    <p>quite interesting right! come lets look into it.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>1.
HAPPY MEDIUM</h3>
                    <p> The reason why being a teenager is great is because it is the only time of our life when we find a happy medium between childhood and adulthood. We can blame our immaturity for the childish things that we do but still use the ‘I am almost an adult’ card when convenient. Other times, we can somewhat enter the adult life without having to take on all of the responsibilities that come with it. If you think about it, teenagers are like the anchors that tie together the childhood life and the adult life.
</p>
                    <h3>2.
AN EXCUSE TO TRY DIFFERENT THINGS</h3>
                    <p> Teen years come with exploration opportunities. It is absolutely acceptable for teens to change their hairdos or fashion style whenever they feel like it because after all, we have to try it all before we find one that depicts our true selves. We call those periods of change ‘phases’ and we all go through them, no matter how embarrassing it is to look back at them.</p>
                    <h3>3.
LIFE FILLED WITH EXCITING THINGS</h3>
                    <p>For some, teenage years are the peak of their lifetimes, which is understandable. Your teen years are filled with your ‘firsts’: your first concert, first real relationship, first car, etc. There are lots of exciting things you can look forward to in the period of adolescence. During adulthood, our lives usually normalize and revolve around a routine; therefore, there is not much room for excitement.</p>
                    <h3>4.
ROOM FOR MISTAKES</h3>
                    <p>What is great about being a teenager is that you have more room to make mistakes. Chances are that you won’t be penalized for not knowing better, because you don’t yet fully develop common sense. Therefore, adolescence is a learning experience, which can be viewed as practice before you are launched into a real world on your own.</p>
                    <h3>5.
MORE FREEDOM, LESS RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
                    <p>Another one of the perks of being a teenager is finally having freedom and control over your life. There is more flexibility in taking on a hobby and hanging out with friends because your parents are there to support you. They loosen their grasp on your life and finally let you make the decision on your own.</p>
                    <h3>6.
BEING IN YOUR BEST SHAPE</h3>
                    <p>If you haven’t noticed, some of the best athletes peak in their performances during their teenage years, and while most of us are nothing like athletes, our bodies still function along the same lines. Our metabolism is at its highest, so it is more than likely that you are currently in the best shape you will ever be. Now, might as well enjoy it while you can and say yes to that dessert!</p>
                    <h3>7.
HAVING SUMMER OFF</h3>
                    <p>As teenagers, one thing that we talk about yearlong is summer! We look forward to it the second that it ends and meticulously count down the days. However, a time will come when summer is not going to differ that much from all of the other seasons, so this is also one of the best things about being a teenager.

Going through adolescence can oftentimes be hard and troublesome, but in the end there are too many things that outweigh the disadvantages. Teen years are truly valuable and unforgettable. What are some of your favorite teenage memories?</p>
